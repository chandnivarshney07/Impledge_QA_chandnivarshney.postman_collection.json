#Delivery Verification System
The Delivery Verification System is designed to ensure that shipment addresses are accurate and complete, minimizing delivery errors. It verifies the provided address details, such as company name, street address, city, state, zip code, and country, against predefined standards. The system also collects essential contact information, including phone numbers and emails, to facilitate communication between the shipper and recipient.

By using this system, businesses can streamline their logistics processes, reduce the risk of misdeliveries, and enhance customer satisfaction. The system is efficient and easily integrates into any delivery workflow to help ensure shipments reach their intended destinations without delay.
